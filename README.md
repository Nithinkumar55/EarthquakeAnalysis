# EarthquakeAnalysis
demonstrate ability to work with Pyspark.

**Project Overview:**

The Earthquake Analysis project aims to analyze seismic activity data to gain insights into earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and geographical patterns. This project utilizes PySpark, a powerful Python library for distributed data processing, to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Prerequisites:**

Before running the Earthquake Analysis project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
Python (3.x recommended)
PySpark
Matplotlib (for visualization)


**Usage:**
**Start the PySpark session:**

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("EarthquakeAnalysis").getOrCreate()

**Load earthquake data:**

earthquake_data = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("path/to/earthquake_data.csv")
Explore and analyze the data using PySpark operations.

Visualize the results with Matplotlib or other preferred visualization tools.
Save the analyzed data or results.

**Stop the PySpark session:**

spark.stop()

**Data Source:**
The earthquake data used in this project is sourced from USGS. You can download the dataset from here.

**Analysis:**
The project includes basic analyses such as calculating average magnitudes, identifying patterns, and grouping earthquakes by location.

**Visualization:**
Matplotlib is used for basic visualization, including bar charts to display the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

**Contributing:**
We welcome contributions! Read the Contributing Guidelines for details on how to contribute to this project.
